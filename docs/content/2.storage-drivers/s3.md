Driver: `s3`

This storage driver stores the cache in a S3 compatible storage, e.g. AWS S3 or MinIO.

## Configuration

### `docker-compose` MinIO example

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
version: '3.9'

services:
  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000

      STORAGE_DRIVER: s3
      STORAGE_S3_BUCKET: gh-actions-cache

      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: access_key
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: secret_key
      AWS_ENDPOINT_URL: http://minio:9000
    volumes:
      - cache-data:/app/.data

  minio:
    image: quay.io/minio/minio
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: access_key
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret_key

volumes:
  cache-data:
```

### `docker-compose` AWS S3 example

This example assumes that credentials are being provided by the environment, e.g. via an [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) or [EKS IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
version: '3.9'

services:
  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000

      STORAGE_DRIVER: s3
      STORAGE_S3_BUCKET: gh-actions-cache

    volumes:
      - cache-data:/app/.data

volumes:
  cache-data:
```

### Environment Variables

The only required S3-related environment variables are `STORAGE_DRIVER: s3` and `STORAGE_S3_BUCKET`. The rest of the environment variables are optional and depend on your S3-compatible storage provider.

The AWS SDK will automatically use any AWS credentials available in the environment, e.g. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION`. Outside of AWS, these environment variables can still be used to authenticate with S3-compatible storage, as seen in the Minio example above.

Common environment variables are listed below. For a full list of configuration options, see the [AWS SDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/settings-reference.html#EVarSettings).

#### `STORAGE_S3_BUCKET`

Example: `gh-actions-cache`

The name of the S3 bucket used for storage. This environment variable is always required.

#### `AWS_REGION`

Example: `us-east-1`

The AWS SDK relies on this variable being set. In the cache server, it defaults to `us-east-1` if not provided. This has no effect if you are using a non-AWS S3-compatible storage provider, such as MinIO.

#### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Example:
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: access_key`
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: secret_key`

This is the access key/secret key used to authenticate with S3-compatible storage. If required to authenticate with your provider, these should be provided by the provider. Alternatively, you can use the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to specify a profile from your AWS credentials file.

#### `AWS_PROFILE`

Example: `my-profile`

If you wish to run the cache server locally and utilize a profile from your AWS credentials file or local AWS CLI configuration, you can set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to the name of the profile. Note that this will also require mounting the AWS credentials file into the container in order for the SDK to be able to find it.

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
version: '3.9'

services:
  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000

      STORAGE_DRIVER: s3
      STORAGE_S3_BUCKET: gh-actions-cache

      AWS_PROFILE: my-profile

    volumes:
      - cache-data:/app/.data
      # Mount the AWS CLI credentials and config into the container
      - ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro

volumes:
  cache-data:
```

#### `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`

Example: `http://minio:9000`

This is the endpoint URL for the S3-compatible storage. This is only required if you are using a non-AWS S3-compatible storage provider, such as MinIO.
