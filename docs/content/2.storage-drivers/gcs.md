description: Because GCS doesn't support out-of-order multipart uploads (as of November 2024), the cache server will upload the parts into a temporary folder. To combine the parts into a single object, it will download all the parts and re-upload the combined object. This means using GCS as your storage driver will use 3x the bandwidth compared to other storage drivers.
