description: Deploy the GitHub Actions Cache Server using Docker and use it with self-hosted runners
---

The cache server comes as a Docker image and can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## 1. Deploying the Cache Server

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
services:
  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
      - '8000:8000'
    environment:
      API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000
      CA_KEY_PATH: /run/secrets/ca_key
      CA_CERT_PATH: /run/secrets/ca_cert
    volumes:
      - cache-data:/app/.data
    secrets:
      - ca_key
      - ca_cert

volumes:
  cache-data:

secrets:
  ca_key:
    file: ./key.pem
  ca_cert:
    file: ./cert.pem
```

### Environment Variables

#### `API_BASE_URL`

- Example: `http://localhost:3000`

The base URL of your cache server. This needs to be accessible by your runners as it is used for making API requests and downloading cached files.

#### `CA_KEY_PATH`

Path to the CA key. This is used for proxying HTTPS requests which is needed for intercepting cache requests.

#### `CA_CERT_PATH`

Path to the CA certificate. This is used for proxying HTTPS requests which is needed for intercepting cache requests.

#### `STORAGE_DRIVER`

- Default: `filesystem`

The storage driver to use for storing cache data. For more information, see [Storage Drivers](/getting-started/storage-drivers).

#### `DB_DRIVER`

- Default `sqlite`

The database driver to use for storing cache metadata. For more information, see [Database Drivers](/getting-started/database-drivers).

#### `ENABLE_DIRECT_DOWNLOADS`

- Default: `false`

If set to `true`, will send a signed URL to the runner. The runner can then download the cache directly from the storage provider. This is useful if you have a large cache and don't want to proxy the download through the cache server.

::

#### `CACHE_CLEANUP_OLDER_THAN_DAYS`

- Default: `90`

The number of days to keep stale cache data and metadata before deleting it. Set to `0` to disable cache cleanup.

#### `CACHE_CLEANUP_CRON`

- Default: `0 0 * * *`

The cron schedule for running the cache cleanup job.

#### `UPLOAD_CLEANUP_CRON`

- Default: `*/10 * * * *`

The cron schedule for running the upload cleanup job. This job will delete any dangling (failed or incomplete) uploads.

#### `PROXY_PORT`

- Default: `8000`

The port the proxy server should listen on.

#### `PROXY_SCHEME`

- Default: `https`

The scheme the proxy server should listen on.

#### `NITRO_PORT`

- Default: `3000`

The port the server should listen on.

#### `TEMP_DIR`

- Default: os temp dir

The directory to use for temporary files.

## 2. Setup with Self-Hosted Runners

### Generate CA Key and Certificate

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 3650 -nodes
```

This will create a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` file in the current directory. These files need to be mounted into the cache server container.

### Update the Dockerfile of your runner image

```dockerfile [Dockerfile]
# Add the CA certificate to trusted certificates
RUN sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates
RUN echo "<YOUR GENERATED CERTIFICATE>" | sudo tee /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cache-server-ca.crt
RUN sudo update-ca-certificates

# Configure NodeJS to use the CA certificate
ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cache-server-ca.crt

# Configure proxy
ENV http_proxy=http://<your cache server>:<PROXY_PORT>
ENV https_proxy=http://<your cache server>:<PROXY_PORT>
```

## 3. Using the Cache Server

There is no need to change any of your workflows! ðŸ”¥

If you've set up your self-hosted runners correctly, they will automatically use the cache server for caching.
